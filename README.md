Ayooo guys
I'm Arthur Witt, a Brazilian developer and CyberSecurity student.

My favorite Development Language is Python, but i have other languages that i can easily write codes, like js.

Like others brazilians, i speak Portuguese. But speak English like my second language.
I'm Studing German and Spanish, and i am loving the experience

I have a lot of hobbies like play videogames, go out with friends, go to parties, and go to the gym.

I'm studing Cybersecurity for some years, and i am learning a lot of things, and that is what i want to do as my job
